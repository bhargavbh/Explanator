Explanator depends on a recent (>= 4.04.0) version of the OCaml compiler.

To install ocaml and some additional libraries use opam - ocaml's
package manager. For example:

    apt-get install opam
    opam switch 4.05.0
    eval $(opam config env)
    opam install safa menhir

then compile Explanator with

    make

to obtain a binary explanator.native file and

    ./explanator.native -fmla examples/ex1.ltl -log examples/ex1.log

to run an example.

    ./explanator.native -?

provides some additional hints about the tool's user interface.
